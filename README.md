# Formating a Hard Drive in Windows

1. Open diskmgmt.msc (Disk management)

2. Look for the drive you want to format from the list, feel free to open the drive to ensure it's the driveyou want to format

3. Right click the drive once you know it's the drive you want to format, then click format

4. NOTE: Once formatted, the data on the drive will likely not be recoverable

5. If you're formatting a new drive, it'll likely show up as RAW in the File System column at the top ofDisk Management

6. Now we come to the volume label, this is simply naming the hard drive, name it to your heart'sdesires.

7. Next up, the file system, the newest is NTFS so this is the recommended option

8. In the allocation unit size section, choose default

9. Next, the Perform a quick format checkbox, this is marked by default, unmark it so that astandard format is performed. A standard format is when each individual sector (or part) of the driveis checked for errors and overwritten with a zero.

10. Now, the enable file & folder compression setting, this is unmarked by default, stick with thatoption
